      <em>(2011-07-12)</em> we released draft 0.6 of the book <em>darktable</em>.
 this is meant to be a comprehensive guide to the use of darktable for 
the most common development workflows. this is a book for beginners who 
do not want just to know how to develop an image, but looking for more
information on digital photography and how it applies to darktable. 
check out the <a href="http://api.ge.tt/0/2OZkBP1/2/blob/download">pdf</a> or <a href="http://api.ge.tt/0/2OZkBP1/1/blob/download">packaged</a> version and send your comments and feedback to the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/darktable-users">darktable user list</a>.

      <em>(2011-06-01)</em> we <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/0.9/darktable-0.9.tar.gz/download">released version 0.9</a>, with many new features:
      <ul>
        <li>run-time switchable opencl to exploit all the power of your GPU whenever you decide to install the driver</li>
        <li>many new plugins, including a spot removal tool, better denoising (on raw pixels and non-local means) and many more</li>
        <li>blend operations, overlay your plugin only 20 percent if you want</li>
        <li>spot removal tool</li>
        <li>low light vision tool</li>
        <li>non-local-means denoising (relatively fast for nlmeans, but still slow)</li>
        <li>first part of the google summer of code project already merged</li>
        <li>framing plugin (adds postcard borders to match given aspect ratio)</li>
        <li>tonemapping a lot faster now (probably the fastest high-dimensional bilateral filter available today)</li>
        <li>changed images come with the darktable|changed tag</li>
      </ul>
      more updates to the page/install instructions to come, but you should be good by just extracting the tarball and typing <code>./build.sh</code>.
      enjoy! and thanks to all our many contributors!

    	<img src="images/watt.jpg" class="img" alt="dreggn" /><h1>released 0.6</h1>
      <em>(2010-08-28)</em> finally a new release.. it has been so long that i hardly remember
      all the changes. let's try to list the most important ones:
      <ul>
        <li>libraw 0.10.0-beta3</li>
        <li>tethered shooting mode</li>
        <li>import from camera via gphoto2</li>
        <li>new, improved plugins: vignetting, velvia, grain, denoise (via bilateral filter), color transfer, channel mixer ..</li>
        <li>crop/rotate: straighten tool, perspective correction, guide lines (ported from digikam)</li>
        <li>lots of new input color matrices and base curves</li>
        <li>openexr export</li>
        <li>database format changed, which greatly improves speed (and cuts down used disk memory)</li>
        <li>film strip view in darkroom mode for quick image switching</li>
        <li>cool alternative demosaicing algorithms (ported from rawtherapee): dcb, amaze, vcd, c/a autocorrection</li>
        <li>customizable preset system for all darkroom modules with auto application to matching images, selected by exif</li>
        <li>reworked export system to modularly support export to picasa webalbum, email, or disk in jpg, png, 8/16-tiff, pfm, exr, or 16-ppm.</li>
        <li>lots of performance enhancements (plugins denoise and local contrast are still slow)</li>
        <li>translations: de es fi fr gl nl ru sv</li>
      </ul>
      as always, the release comes with a warning: it will be outdated horribly in very short time (even now git master
      has some really cool new features over the release tarball..).
      thanks to all contributors, translators, and everyone on #darktable!

    	<img src="images/crowrock.jpg" class="img" alt="dreggn" /><h1>0.3 beta released</h1>
      <em>(2009-10-23)</em> there have been some major internal changes in dt since 0.2, and
      some of them result in cool new features for the user, so it is time to pass it on to
      the non-git audience. this includes:
      <ul>
        <li>most processing is now being done in a new color
        space (L a/L b/L). this results in nicer exposure/tonecurve/denoise/color correction results.</li>
        <li>the pixel pipeline is now free to change dimensions of the image, which
        makes a crop/rotate operation (and lensfun in the future) possible.</li>
        <li>the code is now organised as plugins (image operations and views such as lighttable and darkroom).</li>
        <li>the lighttable view can filter and sort by rating.</li>
        <li>color management using lcms.</li>
      </ul>

      <em>(2009-10-08)</em> darktable moved from svn to git. get it from
      <code>git://darktable.git.sf.net/gitroot/darktable/darktable</code>. the svn repository
      is still around, but i will probably remove it in the next couple of weeks.

    	<img src="images/release_0.2.jpg" class="img" alt="dreggn" /><h1>0.2 beta is out!</h1>
      <em>(2009-07-06)</em> there have been some major changes in the last months. first, the processing
      backend has been replaced completely, based on an interface which is able to use libgegl (but currently doesn't,
      until gegl is fast enough). all operations are encapsulated in run-time loaded plug-ins.
      raw reading is now based on libraw-0.8. the lighttable got a slightly different look, and more image
      operations have been implemented (e.g. luma/chroma denoising). <br/>
      this release is still marked <em>beta</em>, which should indicate that not all features are yet in
      (especially some lighttable related tasks such as filtering, sorting etc.), and not everything will
      work bug-free and stable yet.
